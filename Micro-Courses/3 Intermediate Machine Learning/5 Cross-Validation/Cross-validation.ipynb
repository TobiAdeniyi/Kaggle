    "# Introduction\n",
    "Machine learning is an iterative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will face choices about what predictive variables to use, what types of models to use, what arguments to supply to those models, etc. So far, you have made these choices in a data-driven way by measuring model quality with a validation (or holdout) set.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are some drawbacks to this approach. To see this, imagine you have a dataset with 5000 rows. You will typically keep about 20% of the data as a validation dataset, or 1000 rows. But this leaves some random chance in determining model scores. That is, a model might do well on one set of 1000 rows, even if it would be inaccurate on a different 1000 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "At an extreme, you could imagine having only 1 row of data in the validation set. If you compare alternative models, which one makes the best predictions on a single data point will be mostly a matter of luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the larger the validation set, the less randomness (aka \"noise\") there is in our measure of model quality, and the more reliable it will be. Unfortunately, we can only get a large validation set by removing rows from our training data, and smaller training datasets mean worse models!"

    "# What is cross-validation?\n",
    "In **cross-validation**, we run our modeling process on different subsets of the data to get multiple measures of model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could begin by dividing the data into 5 pieces, each 20% of the full dataset. In this case, we say that we have broken the data into 5 \"**folds**\"."
